        "﻿ZILLIQA 2.0 Whitepaper Version 1.0 Abstract - With increasing adoption of blockchain technology across various domains, the heterogeneity of requirements has become inevitable. One-size-fits-all solutions do not meet user expectations, nor does the need to compete for block space on a single chain with fluctuating transaction prices. Just as there is no ideal computing infrastructure that satisfies the needs of all centralized information systems, there exists no single chain that can perfectly fulfill the requirements of all decentralized use cases. This work presents ZILLIQA's new blockchain platform designed to address the heterogeneous requirements of existing and future projects in the Web3 space. It introduces a new scaling concept based on the idea of state sharding. The state is subdivided into several x-shards, whose properties are tailored to the specific needs of the applications running on them. Their common goal is to provide a superior user and developer experience through low latency and fast finality of transactions, Web2-like user-friendliness when interacting with decentralized applications, and seamless interoperability between smart contracts across x-shards and beyond the ZILLIQA universe. I. Introduction The ZILLIQA blockchain platform proposed in 2017 [1] - from here on referred to as ZQ1 - was the first blockchain network to achieve massive scaling via transaction sharding and its smart contract language Scilla designed to enable parallelization. The ZILLIQA 2.0 protocol presented in this work - from here on referred to as ZQ2 - incorporates significant improvements such as faster consensus, on-chain smart accounts, or interoperability with other EVM chains, and refines the paradigm of sharding by introducing sovereign application-specific shards called x-shards. 1 Fig. 1: The nodes of the network operate multiple x-shards, each having its own set of pending transactions (stacked lines on the left) and chain of blocks that starts at the genesis (rightmost rectangle). X-shards are logically separated yet interconnected chains that are operated by a subset of nodes in the ZQ2 network as illustrated in Figure 1. Which nodes are allowed to join which x-shards depends on their permissions. Properties of x-shards such as block size and block time, pricing model and privacy settings are customizable to the needs of their users and are congured on the root x-shard, the ZQ2 mainnet. Unlike ZQ1 that merged microblocks assembled by its shards into a nal block, the ZQ2 protocol doesn’t require x-shards to wait for each other. Each x-shard has its own set of validators that run separate instances of the consensus at their own pace, manage the x-shard’s state and process its transactions. Most importantly, smart contracts deployed on different x-shards can access each other’s state and can interact via intershard messages relayed by validators. These novel primitives became feasible due to the short block intervals, fast nality, and light client support in ZQ2, and are the ingredients of composable intershard applications. The whitepaper is structured as follows. Section II introduces the system settings and adversarial assumptions. Section III describes the cryptographic primitives used in ZQ2. Section IV outlines the data stored by full-nodes: the account-based state model, transactions and blocks. It also describes how light clients access relevant data without storing everything. Section V explains how validator nodes produce and nalize blocks through consensus. Section 2 VI describes how the nodes of the p2p network operate x-shards, connect them with each other and with other EVM chains. Section VII is dedicated to smart contracts and introduces new primitives implemented as precompiles. Section VIII concludes with a description of the tokenomics and governance model of ZQ2. II. System Settings and Assumptions In ZQ2, as in ZQ1, there are two types of entities: users and nodes. Nodes that participate in the consensus are called validators. The validator that proposes the current block is also known as the leader. ZQ2 inherits its native token ZIL from ZQ1 by importing token balances as part of the genesis state from ZQ1. Since the launch of the staking program in 2021, staking pools operated by staked seed nodes have accumulated delegated stake in excess of 30% of the ZIL token supply. In ZQ2, these staked seed nodes take on the role of the mainnet validators, replacing Proof of Work (PoW) with Proof of Stake (PoS). X-shards have the option to use different validators with Proof of Authority (PoA). The adversarial model behind the PoW-based validator selection algorithm in ZQ1 assumed less than ¼ of the network hashrate to be controlled by an adversary. This model required the shard committees to be large: the more nodes randomly selected based on PoW were added to the committees, the lower was the probability of ending up with ⅓ or more byzantine nodes in a committee. However, large committees slowed down the PBFT [2] consensus. In the PoS-based Fast-HotStuff [3] consensus used in ZQ2, the supermajority is determined by the sum of the validators’ stake and not by their number. The adjusted adversarial model assumes less than ¼ of the staked ZIL to be controlled by an adversary. Validators are not selected randomly, but are delegated by stakers. Under the new adversarial assumption, it’s easy to prove that any validator set that includes more than 75% of the total stake can not contain ⅓ or more adversarial power. The protocol provides PoA as another option for x-shards to establish their validator set. Unlike PoS, PoA relies on the real-world reputation of known entities operating the validator nodes. Their selection is based on the specic criteria of the individual x-shards. Like in PBFT, the voting power of validators is unweighted and the supermajority is dened as ⅔ of the validators. III. Cryptographic Layer ECDSA [4] instantiated with the secp256k1 curve has been used to authenticate users since the launch of ZQ1, and remains unchanged in ZQ2. The ZQ1 protocol used Schnorr signatures at the p2p networking layer, which included a proprietary gossip implementation. ZQ2 uses libp2p [5] and its nodes are authenticated based on the Ed25519 signature scheme [6]. The consensus layer of ZQ2 uses BLS signatures [7] instead of Schnorr signatures [8] to achieve linearity, allowing for more efcient signature aggregation. While Schnorr requires the cosigners to engage in multiple communication rounds, BLS signatures can simply be aggregated in one round. Unlike suggested in the original HotStuff paper [9], the ZQ2 consensus does 3 not use threshold signatures, which allows it to identify cosigners and detect equivocating validators. Therefore, like the Schnorr multisignatures used in ZQ1, the BLS multisignatures in ZQ2 are also accompanied by a list of cosigners, stored as a bit vector of the validator set. IV. Data Layer The data that all full nodes operating an x-shard maintain consists of the state, transactions that modify the state, and blocks that store the total ordering of transactions agreed by consensus. A. State The protocol uses an account-based state model. ZQ1 distinguished between externally owned accounts (EOA) and smart contracts. While EOAs had only a ZIL balance and a nonce, the state of smart contracts also contained a code hash and a storage root hash. To preserve backwards compatibility with ZQ1’s APIs for smart contracts written in the Scilla programming language, the state of smart contract on ZQ2 contains both the EVM code hash and the optional Scilla code hash. ZQ2 implements native account abstraction, transforming EOAs into smart accounts. Account abstraction improves security and user experience by enabling user accounts to benet from features such as multifactor authentication, authorization of transactions based on daily limits, whitelisted recipients and other rules, multidimensional nonces, sponsored gas fees or gas paid in ERC-20 tokens, to name a few examples. Native account abstraction in ZQ2 is compatible with ERC-4337 [10], enabling it to leverage emerging 3rd party implementations of the aforementioned features. ZQ2 uses its validators as bundlers and implements the entry point as a precompile, allowing for parallel execution of the bundled user operations. The EOAs imported from ZQ1 are automatically converted to smart accounts on ZQ2. Other EOAs are converted to smart accounts the rst time they appear in a transaction. The protocol sets the code hash of the involved EOA to point to the default smart account implementation and populates its storage with initial values. The default smart account implementation mimics EOA behavior, but can be upgraded to provide more sophisticated features anytime by the account owner. The ZQ2 protocol also transforms submitted transactions to user operations so that they can be passed to the entry point for further processing. Transactions that store and retrieve data from a contract's storage pay gas for these operations. However, once data is stored, it has to be kept in the full-nodes' ever-growing persistence even if transactions do not access it. To disincentivize the misuse of contracts as cheap data storage, x-shards have the option to charge a rent for the storage space used by contracts. They can require contract owners to register a rent sponsor for every contract. The sponsor can be the contract itself or another account, from which the rent is deducted every dened number of epochs. If the sponsor's balance is too low, x-shards have the option to reject transactions involving the respective contract or charge an increased gas price to the transaction sender. Contracts that an x-shard wants to subsidize can be exempted from the rent. B. Transactions ZQ2 supports legacy transactions, type-1 transactions specied in EIP-2930 [11] and 4 type-2 transactions specied in EIP-1559 [12]. Legacy transactions consist of the sender's nonce, a gas price, gas limit, destination address, amount, input data and the (𝑣, 𝑟, 𝑠) tuple storing the sender's signature (𝑟, 𝑠) and the parity 𝑣, which can be combined with the chain id as specied in EIP-155 [13]. Type-1 transactions contain an additional access list and their chain id is stored separately from the 𝑣 element of the signature. The optional access list introduced in EIP-2930 allows transactions to specify which parts of the state they are going to access when executing. The use of access lists is incentivized by a discount on the gas charged for the respective opcodes. Type-2 transactions replace the gas price in type-1 transactions with the max fee and the max priority fee as dened in EIP-1559, introducing a fee market based on block utilization. In specic cases, ZQ2 EVM transactions differ from the standard Ethereum transactions described above. For instance, intershard transactions described in section VI. B do not contain a signature from which the sender address could be recovered, so they store the sender contract’s address and x-shard in separate elds. Transactions using instant intershard state reads described in section VII. A also contain the prefetched state values, Merkle proofs and block numbers of other x-shards. Transactions spend 21,000 gas if they do not call smart contracts, otherwise the gas used by the smart contracts is added on top. Every transaction has a gas limit. The total gas available to all transactions in a block is determined by the block limit. The x-shards' block limit is customizable and is part of the parameters stored in the x-shard contract. The ZQ2 mainnet has a block limit of 84 million gas, which covers 4,000 simple transfer transactions and 1,680 contract calls with 50,000 average gas demand. There are many options on how x-shards can handle transaction fees. Some of them pay the gas fees accrued in a block to the block proposer, others distribute them among the validators contributing to the block's QC or burn the fees like the ZQ2 mainnet. There are also several options for gas pricing. In some x-shards, the gas price is at the transaction senders' discretion, other x-shards use a fee market so that the minimum gas price is determined by the utilization of the block space. Some x-shards may implement gas price auctions and others may subsidize the gas price of important smart contracts or grant a discount to users with a certain amount of gas spent during a specied number of preceding blocks. Any of these options are easy to implement using the system-level smart contracts and native account abstraction. Another convenience feature of ZQ2 is to include the encoded error with which transactions reverted in the transaction receipts, allowing light clients to verify that the claimed error indeed occurred. C. Blocks ZQ2 blocks consist of a header, a quorum certicate (QC) or aggregated QCs described below in more detail, and a list of transactions. The block header contains the block height, view number, block hash, parent hash, a Unix timestamp, RANDAO reveal, extra data, the gas limit and the gas used, the emitted logs’ Bloom lter, the state root, transaction root and receipt root, as well as the signature of the block proposer. The Bloom lter and the root hashes are essential for light clients introduced later in this section. 5 QCs and aggregated QCs are essential for the ZQ2 consensus. A QC represents the votes of the validators’ supermajority for a block. It consists of the block hash and view number that the validators voted for along with their multisignature and a bit vector indicating which members of the validator set supplied a vote. Aggregated QCs consist of the supermajority’s aggregated signature over their respective validator index, view number and highest QC, serving as a proof that the supermajority does not hold a higher QC than those included among the aggregated QCs. The light client protocol allows nodes with limited resources to process only the block headers to determine which blocks have been nalized, and request untrusted RPC nodes to provide them with cryptographically veriable data they cannot compute themselves, because unlike full-nodes they do not store and execute transactions. To gure out which block headers are nalized, light clients must follow the commit rule dened by the consensus, and verify the QCs and aggregated QCs in the block headers based on the validator set of the respective x-shard. As the validator sets are managed by smart contracts on the ZQ2 mainnet, they must query a mainnet RPC node using the eth_getProof method, which returns the respective contract’s storage value along with a Merkle proof so that light clients can verify its validity. To reduce the number of RPC calls required for validator set updates, the validator set can only change at epoch boundaries except for the immediate removal of slashed validators described in section VIII. B. Light clients can verify the validity of transaction hashes, event logs and account state included in a block using the transaction root, receipt root and state root included in the block headers. The verication is based on Merkle proofs [14], which allow them to compute the root hash of the Merkle tree storing the respective elements as leaves, and compare it with the root hash in the block header. The Merkle proof of a leaf consists of the hashes of its siblings on every level of the Merkle tree. The computation starts by hashing the leaf. The hash is concatenated with the hash of the sibling, and the result is hashed again to get their parent one level higher in the tree. This step is repeated until we arrive at the root of the tree. While light clients can call the eth_getProof RPC method provided by ZQ2 nodes to query the state of accounts including the storage of contracts and receive Merkle proofs for the results, there is no such RPC method for retrieving event logs along with their Merkle proofs. However, they can execute Algorithm 1 to verify if the event logs returned by an RPC node are valid. To nd out which blocks may contain the logs they are looking for, light clients can check the logsBloom in the block headers they receive. The searched log topics found by the Bloom lter [15] may turn out to be false positives, but if the lter does not contain the topics, light clients know with certainty that they do not have to retrieve the receipts of that block. 6 Python Algorithm 1: Generic event log verication # input: logs from blocks whose logsBloom # indicates positives 1 for log in logs: 2 rcpts = rpc.eth_getBlockReceipts( log.blockHash) 3 4 # check validity of receipts 5 if log.blockNumber not in rcptRoots: 6 rcptRoots[log.blockNumber] = merkle_tree(rcpts).root 7 if block[log.blockNumber].receiptRoot != rcptRoots[log.blockNumber]: 8 raise RootMismatch 9 10 # verify if log included in receipt 11 if log not in rcpts[log.transactionIndex].logs: 12 raise InvalidLogs 13 14 # search for withheld logs 15 moreLogs = [l for l in sum([r.logs for r in rcpts], []) if l not in logs] 16 if any(l.address in filter.address and filter.topics.match(l.topics) for l in moreLogs): 17 raise MissingLogs To allow newly joined nodes to synchronize rapidly, ZQ2 supports weak subjectivity checkpoints. They represent a block which is irreversible and trusted in the same way as the genesis block. The published state and block hash of the last checkpoint must correspond to the state root in the respective block header, which the nodes download on startup. Based on the validator set stored in that state, nodes can validate the subsequent blocks’ headers, execute their transactions and synchronize their state with the rest of the network. The mechanism is also useful for synchronizing light clients. They do not download the checkpoint block’s published state, but request the validator set stored in it using the eth_getProof RPC method and verify the proof against the checkpoint header. V. Consensus Layer ZQ1 implemented an improved version of the PBFT algorithm that reduced its authenticator complexity by routing messages through the consensus leader and by aggregating validator signatures. ZQ2 completely replaced PBFT with Pipelined Fast-HotStuff, an optimized variant of HotStuff [9]. Unlike PBFT, which requires an expensive view change protocol to replace the leader in case of a failure, or Tendermint, which waits for the maximum network delay before leader rotation, HotStuff preserves linearity and responsiveness at the same time. Achieving both properties comes at the cost of 3 instead of 2 rounds of voting, but the pipelined version called Chained HotStuff unies them in a generic voting round, utilizing the same message to represent different phases of multiple views at the same time. A. Block Production and Finalization Fast-HotStuff [3] improves HotStuff by reducing the number of rounds to 2 at the cost of an acceptable overhead in case of view changes triggered by timeouts. In Pipelined Fast-HotStuff used in ZQ2, the current leader broadcasts a new block proposal along with a QC of its parent block. If the proposed block’s view number is one larger than its QC’s view number and is larger or equal to the validator’s local view number, the validator regards the proposed block as safe and sends its vote with the signed block hash and view number to the next leader. This case is depicted at the top in Figure 2. 7 Fig. 2: The Pipelined Fast-HotStuff safe proposal rule. The new block is safe either if its parent was proposed in the previous view (top) or is referred to by the highQC among its aggQCs (bottom). The new leader collects such votes from the supermajority to form a new QC and propose the next block. If validators do not receive a safe block proposal before the timeout expires, they send a new-view message with a signature over their local view number and the highest QC they have received so far to the next leader. The next leader collects new-view messages from the supermajority and includes their aggregate signature in the proposed block. Validators receiving the proposal consider it safe if the block extends from the highest QC among the aggregated QCs attached to the block. The bottom part in Figure 2 illustrates this case. Fig. 3: The Fast-HotStuff commit rule. The block from view 𝑣 is nalized when its child from view 𝑣 + 1 becomes extended from by a new block in a later view. The two-direct-chain at the bottom illustrates the case when the extending block is from view 𝑣 + 2. The commit rule of Pipelined Fast-HotStuff is simple: if a two-chain with a direct chain between the parent block and the grandparent is reached, the grandparent and all of its ancestors can be executed. Consequently, blocks are nalized after two consecutive blocks in the common case. With an average block time of approx. 2 seconds, it takes around 5 seconds to nalize a block. It’s worth noting that the block tags safe and finalized used in several RPC methods denote the block referenced by the RPC node’s local highQC and the block with the highest number corresponding to the Pipelined Fast-HotStuff commit rule, respectively. B. Supermajority and Leader Denition X-shards can use Pipelined Fast-HotStuff in PoA or PoS mode, depending on the composition of their validator set. In PoA mode, reaching supermajority is dened as the number of validator votes being larger or equal to ⅔ of the size of the validator set. In PoS mode, the supermajority is reached when the sum of the stakes of the voting validators exceeds ⅔ of the stake held by the validator set. Note that PoA can be considered as a special case of PoS where validator votes are weighted by 1 instead of the voting validator’s stake. The frequency of selecting a PoS validator as leader must be proportional to its share of the validator set's total stake. The leader selection algorithm in ZQ2 uses the RANDAO randomness accumulator [16] known from the Ethereum beacon chain. It requires block proposers to reveal their BLS signature over the current view number in their blocks. Nodes receiving a new block update the RANDAO mix by XORing its previous value with the hash of the BLS signature revealed in the proposed block. The result is available to smart contracts 8 executed in the next block through the global variable block.prevrandao in case they need a source of randomness, and is also used by the nodes at the beginning of every epoch to seed a random number generator that determines the block proposers of the next epoch. The choice of the epoch length in number of blocks, which is part of the x-shards' conguration settings, poses a security tradeoff, as it allows anyone to know several block proposers in advance, entailing the risk of bribing or attacking them. On the other hand, the longer the epochs, the lower the impact of the biasability of the leader selection by malicious block proposers who have the choice of revealing their BLS signature or withholding it by simply not proposing a block at the end of the epochs. PoS validators that want to join or leave the validator set must wait until the end of the next epoch to be effectively added or removed. After leaving, however, their stake remains locked until the end of the unbonding period. Pipelined Fast-HotStuff eliminates Chained HotStuff’s vulnerability to forking attacks. A malicious leader who sees a two-chain consisting of a grandparent, parent and child block can propose a new block that uses the QC referring to the grandparent instead of forming a new QC referring to the child in the two-chain. The proposed block is safe according to the rules of Chained HotStuff, and the next leader will extend from it. Thus, however, the malicious leader managed to invalidate two blocks, the parent and the child in the two-chain, delaying all transactions that they contained and need to be included in future blocks again. Pipelined Fast-HotStuff prevents forking attacks as leaders must either extend from the block proposed in the previous view or include an aggregated QC to prove that the block from an older view they extend from corresponds to the highest QC held by the supermajority of the validators. Thus, malicious leaders are unable to misuse an older QC to propose a block which invalidates other blocks to increase their share of the total stake. VI. Network Layer ZQ1 used designated seed nodes to serve requests and collect transactions submitted via the RPC interface. Separate lookup nodes dispatched the transactions to the validator nodes, which processed the transactions assigned to their shard. Nodes in ZQ2 can serve RPC requests, process blocks and transactions, and participate as validators 1 in the consensus of multiple x-shards at the same time. Furthermore, they can use the light client protocol to interact with x-shards via untrusted full nodes. A. Public and Private X-Shards ZQ2 changed its scaling approach from the tightly coupled shards of ZQ1 to a new paradigm called x-shards. X-shards are sovereign chains on a shared p2p network with customizable consensus parameters, privacy settings and pricing schemes. They allow applications deployed on the network to operate according to their requirements without competing with each other for block space. X-shards are managed on the ZQ2 mainnet. After setting up the nodes that form the genesis validator set of a new x-shard, the x-shard can be registered by submitting a transaction on the mainnet. The x-shard registry maintains the list of the contracts governing the individual 1 Validator nodes are connected to the rest of the public network through sentry nodes protecting them from denial-of-service attacks. 9 x-shards and their intershard communication links. The x-shard contracts store the genesis hash and consensus parameters of the respective x-shard, maintain its validators and active validator set, and authorize intershard communication links from other x-shards. All registered x-shards have a communication link to the ZQ2 mainnet. In case of x-shards using the privacy option, all transactions are AES256 encrypted with a symmetric key shared only among the members of that x-shard. Only the block headers of private x-shards are left unencrypted to enable light clients to verify them. When new nodes join a private x-shard, they request the history of encryption keys from the validators stored in the shard contract on the ZQ2 mainnet. Sharing historic keys is required to enable new member nodes to decrypt and replay all transactions starting from the genesis block. Before sharing the keys, validators verify if the new node is indeed a valid member of the x-shard. The verication is implemented by a smart contract deployed on the private x-shard so that it can only be called by existing member nodes. When nodes leave a private x-shard, the remaining members must agree on a new encryption key to prevent the leaving node from decrypting future transactions. The new key is generated by the leader a number of blocks specied in the x-shard parameters before the leaving node is effectively excluded from the x-shard, in order to give the remaining nodes enough time to receive the new key. The said leader uses Dife-Hellman Key Exchange [17] to share the new key with them, sending them corresponding messages over the p2p network. The RPC nodes in a private x-shard must authenticate the requests to prevent the disclosure of any private information to unauthorized parties. This also applies to light clients used by the validators of other x-shards, which must be notied about events representing intershard calls. B. Intershard Communication Unlike the shards in ZQ1, x-shards are more loosely coupled. They have their own state and transactions, which can call smart contracts deployed on the same x-shard. They can also interact with contracts deployed on other x-shards using a native intershard messaging protocol 2 . All validators of the local x-shard are light clients of the remote x-shards the local x-shard is connected with. Because they know the consensus rules (PoS or PoA) and the validator set of the remote x-shards, they can determine when the remote x-shards' blocks become nal. In each block nalized on a remote x-shard they search for logs of events indicating intershard transactions emitted on the remote x-shard. Since light clients know only the block headers of the remote x-shards, they must verify the logs they receive from the full nodes of the remote x-shards against the receipt root included in the block headers. Intershard communication events emitted on the remote x-shard contain the address of the sender contract that requested the intershard call and the address of the target contract on the local x-shard the call must be sent to, as well as the call data, gas limit and gas price. 2 The protocol can be used in a hub and spoke model where x-shards connect to the ZQ2 mainnet, or in a point to point model where two x-shards communicate directly. 10 Fig. 4: The contract requests an intershard call to the 𝐶𝐴𝐿𝐿𝐸𝑅 𝑆𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑂𝐺𝐴𝑇𝐸 contract’s deliver() function with the target addresses and 𝑇 1 𝑇 and call data and to be used by the as arguments. The target x-shard’s consensus includes a transaction in 2 𝐶 1 𝐶 2 𝑆𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑂𝐺𝐴𝑇𝐸 𝐿𝐸𝐴𝐷𝐸𝑅 its proposed block that calls the 𝑆𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑂𝐺𝐴𝑇𝐸 contract’s deliver() function. As depicted in Figure 4, when the local x-shard's leader proposes the new block, it includes intershard transactions constructed from the event logs that were retrieved from the remote x-shards' nalized blocks. The block is propagated to the local x-shard's validators that send a consensus vote for the block, attesting to the included intershard transactions, and execute them along with the regular transactions in the block. Intershard transactions call the target contract with the calldata, gas limit and gas price specied in the event emitted on the remote x-shard. The message sender of the call is set to the address of the sender contract deployed on the remote x-shard that requested the intershard call3 . The gas fee is charged from the sender's balance in the local x-shard's native token. The target contract on the 3 The transaction nonce is set to u64::MAX. Intershard transactions also contain a UCCB nonce to maintain compatibility with cross-chain transactions and to ensure the uniqueness of intershard transaction hashes. local x-shard can request an intershard call back to the sender contract on the remote x-shard, informing it about the result of the intershard transaction executed on the local x-shard. C. Cross-Chain Communication Interoperability with other EVM chains is another key property of the ZQ2 plattform. Cross-chain applications such as token bridges and atomic swaps are facilitated by the Universal Cross-Chain Broker (UCCB) integrated into the ZQ2 protocol. It supports interactions between smart contracts deployed on different EVM chains, allowing them to send asynchronous messages to each other. The cross-chain messages and their results are relayed between the source and the target chain by the ZQ2 validators after collecting signed acknowledgements from the supermajority. By using globally unique chain ids to specify the target, smart contracts can call each other on any chain that is part of the UCCB network. 11 Fig. 5: The 𝐶𝐴𝐿𝐿𝐸𝑅 contract requests a cross-chain call to the 𝑆𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑂𝐺𝐴𝑇𝐸 contract’s deliver() function with the target addresses 𝑇 and 1 𝑇 2 and call data 𝐶 and to be used by the as arguments. The validators collect the supermajority’s signatures and the 1 𝐶 2 𝑆𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑂𝐺𝐴𝑇𝐸 𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑆 consensus 𝐿𝐸𝐴𝐷𝐸𝑅 submits a transaction to the 𝑈𝐶𝐶𝐵 contract, passing the 𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑆 and the requested call to its dispatch() function. When contracts send a cross-chain message, a UCCB event is emitted on the source chain. The event encodes the source and target contract address, the call data, and the source and target chain id. Validators keep track of nalized blocks on the source chain and retrieve all UCCB events emitted in a block. They form a Merkle tree from the events, sign its root hash and acknowledge the events by broadcasting their signature on the ZQ2 mainnet' p2p network. If the current leader witnesses signatures by the supermajority of the validators, it starts to dispatch the cross-chain messages encoded in the leaves of the Merkle tree. The leader submits a transaction to the target chain, calling the dispatch function of the UCCB contract with the encoded cross-chain message along with its Merkle proof and the Merkle root signed by the supermajority of the validators as arguments. The current leader dispatches as many cross-chain messages as possible, depending on the target chain’s gas limit. In case a validator does not manage to deliver all cross-chain messages during its tenure as leader, the next leader continues dispatching the pending messages. The UCCB contract veries the signatures and passes the encoded target address and call data to the surrogate contract that was specied by the source contract. The UCCB contract manages deposits made on behalf of the surrogate contracts and limits the gas available to them according to the deposit. It meters the surrogates’ gas usage and refunds the leaders’ transaction costs from the respective deposits. It also rewards the validators that signed the cross-chain message by deducting additional fees from the surrogates’ deposit. Furthermore, the UCCB contract manages the UCCB nonces 4 embedded in the cross-chain messages to prevent replay attacks. The surrogate contract decodes the target address and call data, and performs the requested call. If the cross-chain message encodes multiple calls, the surrogate 4 The UCCB nonce is unique per source chain, but unlike the transaction nonce, it is not sender-specic. The ZQ2 validators use the UCCB nonce to keep track of pending cross-chain transactions. 12 Python contract executes them in the specied order. The surrogate contract can collect the success ags and the return values or the errors that occurred during the calls, encode them and request the UCCB contract to send a cross-chain message back to the source contract, informing it about the results. Cross-chain messages can contain an application-specic unique identier, so that source contracts can easily match the results received to the cross-chain messages sent. D. Commonalities and Applications The validators facilitating intershard and cross-chain transactions run light clients of the connected chains and x-shards, to retrieve the logs of the UCCB events emitted in every nalized block. They check the Bloom lter of every block header and request the RPC node to provide them with the receipts only if the lter indicates positives. Since all logs returned by the RPC node will have the same block number, they can use a single eth_getBlockReceipts RPC call to get all receipts of the respective block and check locally which of them contain logs of UCCB events as presented in Algorithm 2. The programmer's interface, i.e. how smart contracts request remote calls by asking UCCB to emit the respective event, is the same for both intershard and cross-chain transactions. The main difference is in the way of relaying the requested remote calls. While intershard communication integrated natively into the ZQ2 validator protocol piggybacks the involved x-shards' consensus to get their supermajority’s conrmation for the intershard transactions, cross-chain communication requires the ZQ2 validators to collect the supermajority's signatures and the UCCB contract deployed on the target chain to verify the signatures before calling the surrogate contract. This makes cross-chain transactions more expensive than intershard transactions, which do not incur any additional gas overhead. Algorithm 2: UCCB event log verication # input: blockNum, logs 1 rcpts = rpc.eth_getBlockReceipts(blockNum) 2 # check validity of receipts 3 if block[blockNum].receiptRoot != merkle_tree(rcpts).root: 4 raise RootMismatch 5 6 # verify if logs included in receipts 7 if any(log for log in logs if log not in rcpts[log.transactionIndex].logs): 8 raise InvalidLogs 9 10 # search for withheld logs 11 moreLogs = [l for l in sum([r.logs for r in rcpts], []) if l not in logs] 12 if any(l.address in filter.address and filter.topics.match(l.topics) for l in moreLogs): 13 raise MissingLogs Both UCCB and intershard communication involve a minimal delay due to the time to nality on the source chain. The trustworthiness of both is rooted in the security of the ZQ2 consensus. As long as the consensus guarantees safety and liveness, so do cross-chain and intershard transactions using the ZQ2 mainnet validators. ZQ2’s cross-chain and intershard communication provide the foundation for canonical bridges supporting ERC-20 tokens and NFTs. It’s worth noting that ZRC-2 tokens and ZRC-6 NFTs can also be bridged due to the possibility of wrapping them in an ERC-20 and ERC-721 contract. We illustrate how straightforward the 13 implementation is on the example of an ERC-721 bridge between ZQ2 and another EVM chain. The bridge consists of an escrow contract deployed on ZQ2 and a surrogate contract on the other chain. The escrow contract implements the ERC721Receiver interface. When a token id is transferred to it, its onERC721Received function makes a remote call to the surrogate contract on the other chain, requesting it to mint a wrapped NFT with the same token id. When later on the wrapped NFT is transferred to the surrogate contract on the other chain, its onERC721Received function burns it and requests the escrow contract on ZQ2 to transfer the original NFT to the address that returned the wrapped NFT. VII. Smart Contract Layer ZQ2 integrates a Rust-based EVM implementation supporting both the precompiles that were added to Ethereum throughout its hard forks, as well as other precompiles available exclusively on ZQ2. Besides EVM-compatible smart contract developement languages, frameworks and tools, ZQ2 also supports Scilla, initially with an interpreter like in ZQ1, and later by compiling the Scilla source code to EVM bytecode. ZQ2 provides full interoperability between native Scilla and EVM contracts, making it possible for ZRC-2 fungible tokens to have an ERC-20 proxy and vice versa. Furthermore, ZQ2 imports the entire ZQ1 state, so ZQ1 accounts including Scilla contracts are stored at the same address on ZQ2 as on ZQ1. To preserve backwards compatibility with wallets and other tools, and to ensure seamless interaction with the imported Scilla contracts, ZQ2 also supports the APIs provided by ZQ1. Furthermore, ZQ2 improves interoperability between Scilla and EVM not only for smart contracts, but also for users. While users of ZQ1 needed two separate wallets to sign Scilla and EVM transactions, with the ZQ2 account abstraction they can control their account with both Scilla and EVM wallets. A. Instant Intershard State Reads As soon as intershard communication is set up between two x-shards, smart contracts on one x-shard can read the state including storage values of smart contracts on the other x-shard, and use the values immediately in their current transaction execution. They must call a precompile and refer to the address on the other x-shard and the storage slots they want to retrieve. They can also specify a block number of the other x-shard if they are interested in the values at a specic block height. As depicted in Figure 6, the sender’s node must simulate the transaction execution to gure out which addresses and storage slots are required by the precompile. The sender requests the values of the specied storage slots and their Merkle proofs using eth_getProof from an RPC node of the other x-shard, using the block number sent to the precompile or the most recent block nalized on the other x-shard. Finally, the sender supplies the retrieved values, their Merkle proofs and the block numbers used as additional data in the transaction. The block proposer including the transaction in its block runs a light client of the other x-shard, so it checks if the values and Merkle proofs are valid for the block numbers specied in the transaction. When validators receive the block, they check the same and reject the block, if any of the values and Merkle proofs were invalid. 14 Fig. 6: Handling of intershard state reads by the transaction sender, the x-shard’s validators proposing and validating the block of the transaction and the full nodes executing the transaction When the transaction is executed as part of the block by a non-validating node, the precompile uses the values stored in the transaction. The node does not need to verify the values and Merkle proofs, it can simply rely on the supermajority of the validators that have already veried them. Instant intershard state reads provide an elegant way to implement use cases such as voting based on token balances stored on another x-shard. When the voting contract receives votes, it can simply query the token balances of the voters at a xed “snapshot” block height on the other x-shard. Another use case for instant intershard state reads are price feeds supplied by oracles on another x-shard. Contracts can access the prices stored on those x-shards by querying the respective storage slots at the most recent nalized block height. B. Scheduled Contract Continuations Circumstances like thresholds not yet reached, data not yet supplied by oracles, or other unmet conditions can prevent smart contracts from completing all steps they are supposed to execute. To work around this issue, transaction logic would have to be divided into multiple phases, and users would have to actively track when the obstacles are removed in order to submit a separate transaction that proceeds to the next phase. Scheduled contract continuation is a primitive that allows smart contracts to be automatically invoked when the specied conditions are met to resume the execution of pending steps of previously submitted user transactions. Any contract can request resumption by calling a precompile and passing it the encoded call data of the trigger condition and the call data of the continuation along with the earliest and latest block height and the reward for the validator that enables the resumption. Block proposers between the earliest and latest block 15 height can attempt to include a resumption transaction in their block by evaluating the trigger condition. If they succeed, they will earn the reward, otherwise the next block proposer gets the change to do so. If block proposers include a resumption transaction in their block despite the trigger condition returning false, honest validators will reject the block. If the trigger condition never returns true, the user who submitted the transaction calling the precompile is penalized by paying for the reward in gas charged by the precompile. VIII. Incentive and Governance Layer A. Token Supply The ZQ2 mainnet uses ZIL as its native currency. Fees and rewards are paid in ZIL, and the mainnet validators and their delegators stake ZIL to secure the network. ZIL is natively wrapped in an ERC-20 interface to enable uniform handling as a fungible asset in DeFi applications. X-shards are bootstrapped with a genesis supply assigned to the account that distributes validator rewards and collects burned transaction fees. They have a number of options for the choice of their native token. Their native token and genesis supply can be ZIL bridged from the mainnet. It can also be some amount of another ERC-20 token already deployed on the mainnet and bridged to the new x-shard. This includes stablecoins, which enables x-shards to use them as their native token so that transaction fees and validator rewards are not subject to price uctuations. Another option is to launch the x-shard with a brand new native token that initially only exists on the x-shard. B. Staking Rewards The PoS consensus of ZQ2 requires staking ZIL. Users can deposit ZIL in the staking contract and delegate it to a validator. Users can claim their share of the rewards reduced by the validator’s commission immediately, but withdrawing and transferring their delegated stake to another validator are delayed by the unbonding period inherited from ZQ1. Most validators are run by staking pools, but ZQ2 also allows solo stakers without delegators. While x-shards are free to use their own validator incentives, the tokenomics of the PoS mainnet is baked into the protocol. Its goal is to establish a sustainable yet attractive reward model for earning staking returns while reducing ination to prevent the depletion of the capped ZIL supply without sacricing the staking ratio, which is essential for the network’s security. To achieve this, validator rewards are adjusted regularly based on the utilization of the block space. The formula for calculating the total amount of rewards all validators earn together is dened in Figure 7, where 𝑐 , 𝑆 𝑚𝑆 and 𝑥 are the current, the maximum and 𝑆 the target ZIL supply, 𝑐 and are the 𝑅 𝑥 𝑅 current and the target staking ratio, and 𝑐 𝐹 is the amount of fees burned. The validators are supposed to earn this amount every hour, provided they manage to produce the expected number of blocks. They distribute their share of the rewards later among the delegators in proportion to the delegators’ staked ZIL. 16 𝑍 ℎ = 𝑍 · 1 − 𝑐 𝑆 𝑚𝑆 1 − 𝑥 𝑆 𝑚𝑆 ( ) 𝑇 + 𝑐 𝐹 ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ · 𝑐 𝑅 · 𝐵 𝑥 𝑅−𝑐 𝑅 𝑥 𝑅 ( ) Fig. 7: Total staking rewards the validators are expected to earn per hour. The right hand side of the product calculates an amount based on the transaction fees and the depletion level of the ZIL reserve, and the left hand side adjusts it to encourage staking up to the target staking ratio. The parameters 𝑍, 𝐵 and 𝑇 are dened as follows. 𝑍 is the ZIL token amount from which the total rewards are calculated. Its initial value was chosen so that it enables a smooth transition from ZQ1 to ZQ2 staking rewards. 𝐵 and 𝑇 are two positive constants. To understand their effect, both sides of the product in Figure 7 need to be explained rst. The left hand side is the total amount of rewards the maximum supply would earn if it was staked. In this hypothetical case, each ZIL token would earn 1 / 21 billionth of the amount on the left hand side. The amount contains the burned transaction fees and a fraction of 𝑍 depending on how much the maximum supply is already depleted. As soon as the supply exceeds the target, the fraction of 𝑍 gets rapidly reduced and its value goes to zero as we approach the maximum supply. The larger the 𝑇, the more the fraction of 𝑍 included in the total reward gets throttled, serving as an emergency break to prevent the full depletion of the maximum supply. On the right hand side of the product we have a function which adjusts the amount on the left hand side to the current staking ratio. The higher the staking ratio i.e. more ZIL is staked, the less reward each ZIL will earn because the total reward is divided by the stake. When the current staking ratio is below the target, the formula using 𝐵 > 1 encourages more staking because it increases the amount on the left hand side disproportionally to the stake. The closer the staking ratio gets to the target, the less disproportionally the amount is boosted i.e. the less reward each staked ZIL earns. When the staking ratio exceeds the target, the formula has the opposite effect on the amount on the left hand side. The reward that each staked ZIL earns will drop overproportionately if the staking ratio keeps growing beyond the target in order to discourage further staking. The larger 𝐵 is, the stronger it motivates ZIL holders to stake up to the target ratio but not beyond it. The benet of a higher 𝐵 for stakers before reaching the target ratio comes at the cost of a faster depletion of the ZIL reserve. A carefully chosen value of 𝑇 has the countereffect of slowing down the depletion if the supply gets too close to its maximum. The formula presented in Figure 7 was stress-tested in several simulations. It is used as the basis for revising the validator rewards and the gas price on a monthly basis. If necessary for the long-term sustainability of the system, ZILLIQA proposes adjustments and the nal decision is made by the decentralized governance. The mainnet mints validator rewards at every block, regardless of how long it takes to produce blocks. If block production gets slower than expected, it takes validators longer to earn the reward dened as 17 𝑍 𝑏 = 𝑍 ℎ 𝐸 ℎ · 𝐵𝑒 where ● 𝑍 is the total amount of rewards ℎ from Figure 7, ● 𝐸 denotes the expected number of ℎ epochs per hour, and ● 𝐵 represents the epoch length, i.e. 𝑒 the number of blocks per epoch. The rewards are assigned to the validators as follows: ● Proposer rewards: 50% is given to the block proposer. ● Cosigner rewards: 50% is distributed among the validators that contributed to the QC or aggregated QCs included in the block. The cosigner rewards are assigned in proportion of the validators' stake, i.e. if two validators contribute a signature to the QC or aggregated QCs, but one of them has twice as much stake as the other, then the one with the higher stake receives a share of the cosigner rewards twice as high as the other one. The proposer rewards are the same for every validator that proposes a block since the frequency of being selected as leader is already weighted by the validators’ stake. Validators that do not manage to supply their votes or new view messages fast enough to be included in the QC or aggregated QCs of the next block, have a chance to earn up to 50% of the maximum validator reward if they propose a valid block in the views that they are the leader of, and the proposed blocks get nalized. C. Validator Penalties Faulty validators are penalized by being ● slashed for compromising safety ● suspended for impairing liveness The system contract managing the active validator set keeps track of the validators’ performance as block proposers. When it is requested to return the current validator set, it calls a precompile that scores the validators based on the views in which they were the leader, but their block is missing in the chain. The score determines whether a validator gets suspended and for how many blocks. The score is calculated based on the following formula: 𝑠(𝑖) = 𝑣 = 𝑣 𝑝− 𝑚 𝑣 𝑝 ∑ 𝑣−𝑣 𝑝 ( +𝑚+1) · 𝑙(𝑖,𝑣) · 𝑓(𝑣) · 𝑚𝑎𝑥(1−𝑓(𝑣+1), 𝑙(𝑖,𝑣+1)) 𝑚 where ● 𝑖 is the index of the validator in the validator set, ● 𝑣 is the local view number minus 1 , 𝑝 ● 𝑚 is the number of views before 𝑣 𝑝 to be taken into account, ● 𝑙(𝑖, 𝑣) equals 1 if the validator with the index 𝑖 was the leader of the view 𝑣 and 0 otherwise, ● 𝑓(𝑣) equals 0 if the chain contains a block with view number 𝑣 and 1 otherwise. If 𝑠(𝑖) is above the set threshold, the validator with the index 𝑖 gets suspended for a rounded 𝑠(𝑖) · 𝐵 number of blocks 𝑒 where 𝐵 is the epoch length in blocks. 𝑒 Suspended validators are allowed to send votes for block proposals or new view messages to the next leader, but they are not allowed to propose blocks and thus they forfeit their proposer rewards. 18 Validators do not get suspended for a single block, they are only penalized for repeatedly failing to produce blocks that make it into the chain. The formula also prevents validators from being punished just because the next leader failed. Blocks missing in earlier views are taken into account in the current score, but they weigh less than the most recent blocks. The larger a validator's share of the total stake, the more views it is in charge of, and the sooner it gets suspended if its node is down. This is intended to discourage the centralization of staking pools. If a validator catches a leader equivocating, i.e. proposing multiple different blocks in the same view, or a leader catches a validator equivocating, i.e. sending multiple different votes or new view messages in the same view, they share the evidence with all validators and the leader includes a slashing transaction to record the evidence on-chain. The slashing transaction is submitted to the slashing contract, which calls a precompile to verify the evidence. If the evidence proves the accused validator’s guilt, the slashing contract calls the contract managing the active validator set to remove the validator. The slashing contract also calls the staking contract to seize the slashed fraction of the validator's stake, deduct the slashing reward and transfer it to the sender of the slashing transaction who is the block proposer in the common case. Slashing is applied to the validator and all accounts delegated to the validator including those with a pending request to unstake. The slashed fraction of the stake increases with the total amount slashed in the most recent epochs: 𝑚𝑎𝑥 9 100 , 𝑚𝑖𝑛 1, 3 · 𝑖 ∈ 𝑆 ∑ 𝑠𝑡(𝑖) 𝑖 ∈ 𝐴 ∑ 𝑠𝑡(𝑖) ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ 2 ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ where 𝐴 is the active validator set, 𝑆 ⊂ 𝐴 is the set of validators slashed and 𝑠𝑡(𝑖) denotes the stake of validator 𝑖. Note that the more stake a validator controls that goes beyond 10% of the total stake held by the active validator set, the larger fraction of it will be slashed even if no other validators are slashed in the same epoch. On each additional slashing, the fraction is updated and applied to all validators slashed since the beginning of the epoch. If the evidence checked by the precompile turns out to be invalid, the slashing transaction reverts, but the precompile charges extra high gas to penalize the sender of the invalid slashing transaction. The slashing contract emits an event indicating which validator was slashed. When nodes receive a block containing slashing events, they remove the slashed validators from the active validator set retrieved at the beginning of the epoch. This also includes light clients, which check if a block might contain a slashing event using the Bloom lter in the block header. For views in which one of the suspended or slashed validators would become the block proposer, the leader selection algorithm picks another validator deterministically using the random number generator seeded at the beginning of the epoch. D. Governance Model The ZQ2 mainnet uses the governance token gZIL and the governance framework established in ZQ1. The governance is highly decentralized, involving over 86 thousand gZIL token holders. Token holders with a minimum balance specied by the governance rules are allowed to make proposals. Before 19 submitting a proposal to formal voting, it must be posted on the governance forum on Discourse [18] to allow the community to discuss, give feedback and suggest modications. The nal version of the proposal must achieve over 25% of votes in favor in a poll open for at least 3 days to become eligible for formal voting. Formal voting takes place on Snapshot [19]. It must be open for at least 7 days and requires a quorum determined by the turnout of the last 3 votes and >50% majority approval to pass. All gZIL holders are eligible to participate and the votes they cast are weighted by their gZIL balance at the block height specied when the formal voting is created. Prior to that block height, gZIL holders can delegate part or all of their voting power to one or more delegates. Proposals suggesting modications that require hard forks or are otherwise incompatible with the protocol currently in place, are in addition specied in form of Zilliqa Improvement Proposals published on Github [20]. X-shards can use their own governance token or adopt gZIL optionally combined with other authorization mechanisms to restrict the group of eligible voters. Using gZIL to determine the voting power encourages voters to accumulate gZIL to have more inuence in their x-shard's decision making and at the same time, to have a say in the mainnet governance. This is sensible especially if the x-shard uses ZIL as its native token, as the mainnet governance controls the ZIL ination and other decisions that ultimately affect the ZIL price. IX. Future Research After the launch of ZQ2, research and development will continue focusing on the following areas. A. Post-Quantum Cryptography Quantum computers pose a threat to asymmetric cryptography used in blockchain systems today. ZQ2 implements pluggable cryptography, which allows the schemes initially used to be replaced in the future. While the signing and verication times of post-quantum signature schemes standardized by NIST would make them suitable for authenticating transactions and consensus messages, their signature size makes their use impractical today. Particularly, there are no efcient signature aggregation methods, which are a requirement of our consensus algorithm. EVM transactions except for large contract deployments are a few hundred bytes large. Using e.g. the lattice-based Dilithium [21] with a signature size of 2.7 KB instead of ECDSA would increase the transaction size by one order of magnitude. The Fast-HotStuff block headers contain a QC or an aggregate QC; the rst consists of a BLS multisignature over a block hash and a view number, the second comprises a QC per validator in the supermajority and an aggregate signature. Using Dilithium would require storing the signature of every validator in the supermajority and verifying them one by one. In case of 31 validators in the committee, we would end up with 21 signatures having 56.7 KB in size, which is an increase by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the 96 bytes of BLS signatures. It gets even worse in case of aggregate QCs, which would consist of 21 QCs plus 21 signatures since we have no 20 way to aggregate them; the overhead becomes 1.25 MB compared to approx. 2.2 KB per block header in case of BLS; an increase by 3 orders of magnitude. The signature length tradeoff and the lack of signature aggregation are not specic to lattice-based schemes. The stateful hash-based schemes XMSS [22] and LMS [23] also use signatures larger than 1 KB and the stateless hash-based NIST nalist SPHINCSᐩ [24] generates signatures with a size of tens of KB. The former NIST candidate Rainbow [25] produces small signatures, but requires public keys with hundreds of KB in size and turned out to be vulnerable to key recovery attacks [26]. B. Scaling through Parallelism Parallel smart contract execution has been pivotal to the ZILLIQA protocol since its inception. Noteworthy results included CoSplit [27], a static code analysis tool to infer properties required for parallel scheduling of transaction execution. It was based on the insight that if transactions operate on disjoint parts of the state, or the operations are commutative, their effect does not depend on the order of execution. Unlike CoSplit, which was designed for ZQ1 to assign transactions to shards operating simultaneously and to merge the state changes afterwards, ZQ2 needs parallelism for the multithreaded execution of transactions included in the blocks of every single x-shard. Some of the non-EVM chains existing today require transactions to specify explicitly which parts of the state they are going to use during their execution. This allows the consensus to forgo total ordering in case of transactions that operate on non-overlapping state. In Solana, transactions that write disjoint parts of the state are executed concurrently. In Sui, transactions that access only owned objects are executed in parallel with transactions that don't use any of those objects, bypassing the consensus. While ZILLIQA’s work on parallel transaction execution focused on Scilla contracts in the beginning, the current research is dedicated to parallel EVM pioneered by Block-STM [28], which is integrated in Aptos and Polygon. Block-STM uses optimistic concurrency control. It maintains two ordered sets storing the transactions pending execution and validation, and performs the respective tasks in a multithreaded manner. The preset serialization order prioritizes transactions in both sets according to their index in the block. Every transaction can be executed once or multiple times. During each execution, all state elements read and written are recorded, resulting in the transaction's read and write set. If the write set has not changed since the last execution, only the transaction is scheduled for validation. If it has changed, also the higher transactions that are not pending or in execution are scheduled for validation. During validation, the current values of the state elements in the transaction's read set are compared with the values recorded during execution. If they do not equal due to a lower transaction's write set, the validated transaction is aborted and scheduled for re-execution, and all higher transactions that are not pending or in execution are scheduled for validation. Furthermore, the aborted transaction's write set is invalidated but kept as an estimate of what elements to expect in the write set after the re-execution. If transactions that are being executed read an element marked as an estimate, they are suspended until the transaction that writes the marked element has nished 21 re-execution, and are then executed again. Optimistic parallelization similar to Block-STM was also adopted in Sei V2. Monad complements optimistic execution with transaction dependencies predicted by a static code analyzer, and NodeReal’s Parallel EVM 2.0 integrated in the BNB Smart Chain uses it to speed up nodes that are not the block proposer. Apart from multithreading, another case of parallelism in ZQ2 is a feature called multiblock execution. The execution of transactions that would otherwise exceed the block limit due to the complexity of their EVM computation can be suspended and resumed in subsequent blocks. Multiblock execution requires atomicity and isolation. Dnity’s Deterministic Time Slicing ensures atomicity, but it allows only simultaneous state queries as long as the multiblock computation is not completed - a limitation ZQ2 aims to overcome. C. Consensus Improvements Future improvements to the ZQ2 consensus include secret leader election, validator accountability and frontrunning protection. The random leader selection implemented in ZQ2 reveals the leaders' identity in advance which makes them vulnerable to attacks. Proposals such as Sassafras [29] for Polkadot and Whisk [30] for Ethereum demonstrate how secret leader election can be integrated into existing protocols. Whisk requires Ethereum validators to publish a cryptographic commitment. At the beginning of every 256 epochs (approx. 27 hours), a set of 16,384 commitments are selected using RANDAO as candidates. Every block proposer during the next 8,191 epochs shufes 128 randomly selected commitments and provides a proof of valid shufing. After one more epoch called the cooldown phase where no shufing takes place, the validators select 8,192 commitments as block proposers for the next 256 epochs. The selected validators know for which slot they were chosen as leader and can prove this by opening their commitment in the proposed block. Everyone else only knows that the leaders belong to an anonymity set consisting of at least half of the validators that were among the candidates before the shufing but were not selected to be a block proposer after the shufing. Accountability allows honest validators to provide cryptographic proof to convict malicious validators who deviate from the protocol. Forensic support presented in [31] requires only minor modications to PBFT and HotStuff to enable anyone who detects a safety violation to identify up to 𝑓 + 1 culprits in a up to 2𝑓 malicious majority of 3𝑓 + 1 validators based on the transcript of a single honest validator. These results can also be adapted to Pipelined Fast-HotStuff used in ZQ2. Frontrunning allows block proposers to insert their transactions before other users' transactions to gain disadvantage e.g. in the form of increased MEV at the cost of other users. To protect against frontrunning, Sei uses order batching, a technique also employed by some AMMs. Incoming orders are collected and executed at an average price at predened time periods. It does not matter if an order is rst or last in the batch. Submarine commitments [32] is an example of commit reveal schemes proposed for frontrunning resistance. Users send a deposit to the address of a contract that will be deployed counterfactually later on, amounting to the value they would have sent to the target contract. This is called the commit 22 transaction and it is indistinguishable from other rst-time token transfers to a fresh address. The salt used for calculating the address is the hash of the user's address concatenated with the information the user wants to hide from a frontrunning attacker, e.g. the call data of a buy/sell order. Later on, the user submits a transaction revealing this information along with the block number and the Merkle proof of the commit transaction to the target contract, e.g. the DEX handling the concealed buy/sell orders. This is called the reveal transaction. The target contract counterfactually deploys another contract at the address used in the commit transaction, which it can compute from the user’s address and the revealed information. It calls the deployed contract to recover the deposit before executing the actual logic, the buy/sell order from the example above, based on the revealed information. It also veries if the commit transaction was indeed included in the block specied in the reveal transaction, and the block number is old enough. There is a minimum number of blocks required between the commit and the reveal transactions to prevent malicious block proposers from either reorganizing the block that contains the commit transaction or delaying the inclusion of the reveal transaction, and inserting their own commit and reveal transactions instead. Fino [33] combines a different commit reveal scheme with DAG-based systems like Narwhal [34] and Bullshark [35]. Users encrypt their transactions to ensure a fair, because blind ordering. They use an 𝑓 + 1 out of 3𝑓 + 1 Shamir secret sharing [36] scheme to distribute shares of the decryption key among the validators, where 𝑓 is the upper bound of malicious validators. Unlike the purely smart contract based submarine commitments, Fino's approach requires integration into the consensus protocol. Other approaches propose to use threshold encryption [37], identity-based encryption [38] or trusted execution environments [39] to combat frontrunning. D. Zero-Knowledge Proofs One of the key areas in ZILLIQA’s research are zero-knowledge proofs [40], specically zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, having various use cases in the context of the ZQ2 blockchain platform. The rst of them is an option for x-shards to operate as zk-rollups or validia. In simple terms, rollups are chains that post their blocks to another blockchain called the base layer, using its consensus and block space for data availability. Rollup transactions are stored but not executed on the base layer. Their settlement requires a validity proof of their execution and of the corresponding state transition to be submitted to the base layer for verication. Users send their transactions to the sequencer, which organizes them into blocks, executes them and sends them to the base layer followed by a validity proof generated by the zkEVM prover. Users running full nodes can retrieve the rollup transactions from the blocks of the base layer and execute them to reconstruct the state, and light clients can rely on the rollup state root stored on the base layer. Thus, zk-rollup x-shards do not need an own validator set and consensus. They could be operated by a single entity, although a decentralized permissionless setup is still desirable. The difference between a rollup and a validium is where they store transactions. While rollup transactions are stored inside the blocks 5 of the base layer, transactions of validia use off-chain storage such as data availability committees that publish attestations on the base layer. In 5 After the implementation of Danksharding, Ethereum is going to provide blobs that are larger and cheaper than blocks for storing rollup transactions. 23 some implementations, data availability committees must provide a bond that is slashed in case the data is not available. A volition is a combination of a rollup and a validium that allows users to choose the data availability mode on a per transaction basis. It’s worth noting that despite their use of zero-knowledge proofs, zk-rollups do not provide any means of privacy as their transactions are publicly available, and their state including the code of smart contracts can be reconstructed by executing the transactions. To keep part of the state, transaction inputs and transaction senders secret from the node operators, a protocol needs to support private computation. Unlike in traditional blockchains, where users send transactions containing inputs in the clear and every full node executes smart contracts to update the state, in privacy protocols like Aztec, Mina and Aleo, smart contracts are executed off-chain on the private inputs provided by the user. Transactions submitted on-chain contain only a succinct proof and private smart contracts executed on-chain are merely proof veriers. Private state values are also kept off-chain. The only public information stored on-chain are state commitments and nulliers. Account authentication is part of the private computation to ensure unlinkability across transactions. Another promising application area of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are trust-minimized zk-bridges. Many bridges implement a light client protocol in smart contracts to keep track of the block headers of the other chain and allow users to submit Merkle proofs that can be veried against the root hashes in those block headers. To determine which block headers are valid, the bridge contract must check the other chain's consensus, which is gas-inefcient. Zk-bridges like Telepathy and Polyhedra perform these checks off-chain and submit a zk-proof of consensus to the bridge contract instead. Implementing a zk-proof of Pipelined Fast-HotStuff would enable bridge contracts deployed on other chains to process ZQ2 block headers efciently without the need for the supermajority of ZQ2 validators used by UCCB. The idea of trust-minimized zk-bridges can be extended to trust-minimized zk-oracles like Hyper Oracle [41] that can supply off-chain data, not only block headers of another chain, along with a zk-proof of their validity. Last but not least, users can also leverage zk-SNARKs to prove their identity as demonstrated by the Reclaim protocol [42], or achieve anonymity as realized by Privacy pools.",
        "﻿The Beginner’s Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa is a software that seeks to incentivize a global, distributed network of computers to run a blockchain platform that aims to increase user scalability through sharding. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way, Zilliqa is one of a number of competing blockchains aiming to grow an ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps) and cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Solana and Base.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo differentiate itself from others, Zilliqa uses a sharding process which splits its infrastructure into several interconnected blockchains to support more transactions. \r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa also launched Scilla, a native programming language that focuses on security and enables developers to write and launch customizable dapps intended to replicate real world services.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo achieve all of these features, the network’s native cryptocurrency, ZIL, is used to execute programs, send transactions, and incentivize actors that support the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Created Zilliqa?\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa was launched in June 2017 by co-founders Amrit Kumar and Xinshu Don, two researchers from the National University of Singapore. The network’s mainnet went live in January 2019. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe project held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the ZIL token in 2017, at the time raising over $22 million in ETH. \r\n \r\nHow Does Zilliqa Work?\r\nThe Zilliqa network offers many features common to other cryptocurrency networks such as smart contracting, transaction settlement, and token issuance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers can use its proprietary language, Scilla, to run custom programming logic (smart contracts) and design new programs (decentralized applications) to offer a variety of products and services.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this system is complex in implementation, Zilliqa is ultimately designed to execute smart contracts and confirm network transactions in a scalable and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nSharding\r\n\r\n\r\nSharding is a structural technique that splits the network into several pieces, or shards, allowing nodes to only process a fraction of the network’s transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach shard acts as its own blockchain and allows nodes assigned to them to store data, process transactions and add new blocks to their specific shard chain, called microblocks. \r\n\r\n\r\nMicroblocks are then combined into a transaction block by Directory Service Nodes (or DS nodes) to be added to the Zilliqa blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf note, the shard nodes contain a specific subset of the Zilliqa blockchain, and do not have to store Zilliqa’s entire history.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral to Zilliqa is the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) governance mechanism that keeps the distributed network of computers in sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order for nodes to power the blockchain and vote on changes, they must first stake ZIL, meaning that anyone who owns ZIL can help operate the network. Using pBFT, all nodes assigned to specific shards must agree before a microblock is finalized and combined into a transaction block. \r\n\r\n\r\nEach node is subsequently rewarded with a portion of the block reward for validating the transactions.\r\n \r\nWhy does ZIL have value?\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa’s cryptocurrency, ZIL, plays a key role in maintaining and operating its network, and can be used for holding, sending and staking.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy owning and staking ZIL, users gain the ability to vote on network upgrades, with each vote being proportional to the amount of ZIL coin they stake.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to many other cryptocurrencies, the supply of ZIL is limited, meaning that according to the software’s rules, there will only ever be 21 billion ZIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy use ZIL?\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers may find Zilliqa appealing based on its attempt to create a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, developers may find the platform attractive for products and services that may garner a high volume of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestors may seek to buy ZIL and add it to their portfolio should they believe the market will one day favor more scalable blockchains.\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa Ecosystem\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa has incubated a number of dApps in the entertainment sector…\r\n* WEB3WAR = A FPS game playable on PC, was listed in Microsoft app store and at peak had up to 70k players. Players compete in battles to earn $FPS tokens.\r\n* The Winners Circle = Joint Venture with Racing League. Horseracing prediction game and rewards ecosystem. Players compete to earn $HRSE tokens and can participate in Racing League Governance and purchase shares to real horses.\r\n* The Pride = NFT based Loyalty programme with esports team Mad Lions. \r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa has a number of emerging memecoins who love to interact on twitter. The Memecoins are…\r\n* @Zoge_Coin\r\n* @ZilPepeMemeCoin\r\n* @TacocatOnZIL\r\n* @MEOWZILLIQA\r\n\r\n\r\nMost prominent NFT collection is The Soulless Citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa and AI\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa has recently integrated with AI16Z and GOAT which means that Zilliqa wallets can be used by AI agents. The most prominent AI agents currently are @TacocatOnZIL and @AvaStalion who is also an AI tipster for The Winners Circle project. \r\n\r\n\r\nZ2\r\n\r\n\r\nZilliqa 2.0 AKA Z2is not just a software upgrade, it's a new blockchain client written in Rust. Not only that, it implements a brand new L1 protocol (PoS consensus, P2P networking, EVM & Scilla contracts and more). Actually, even more than that. As our upcoming release will show, we're migrating the entire block history and state of the current Zilliqa mainnet to a new network that uses the new client to run the new protocol. \r\n\r\n\r\nZ2 will be faster, cheaper and more scalable through the use of sharding technology."
